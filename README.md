# Introduction

This project studies the construction of enterprise blockchain-based open source cloud systems based on enhanced security technology, combined with [OpenStack](https://github.com/openstack) open source cloud operating system platform technology, [Ceph](https://github.com/ceph/ceph) decentralized storage technology and its efficiency optimization technology, and thus the basis for the development of enterprise blockchain application service platform required microservice container technology. 

This repository provides enterprise blockchain developers to use the blockchain services, providing enterprise blockchain as a service platform, enabling the acceleration of the blockchain applied to the development of various application services.

The authors are grateful for partial research support from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.
